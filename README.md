# Project Introduction:
  The Rupendra's Food delivery project Created by me includes essential features such as a cart for users to add items, 
  the ability to place orders, providing address details for delivery, and making fake payments for testing purposes. 
  These features simulate a real-world food ordering process, allowing users to seamlessly select their meals, 
  provide delivery information, and complete transactions in a simulated environment, making the app functional and ready for further development.

# Technology Stack Used for this Project:
  This food delivery system is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB for database management, 
  Express.js and Node.js for backend development, and React for the frontend. The stack enables efficient handling of user interactions, 
  real-time order processing, and seamless integration of the cart, order placement, address entry, and fake payment functionalities, making the app highly responsive and scalable.
  
# Brief Info about MERN Stack:
  The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building fullstack web applications using JavaScript. It consists of four key technologies:
      . MongoDB (Database): 
            A NoSQL database used to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format. 
            MongoDB is great for handling large amounts of unstructured data and can easily scale for high-demand applications.
      . Express.js (Backend Framework): 
            A lightweight web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust APIs. 
            It handles the server-side logic and routes for the application, connecting the frontend to the database.
      . React (Frontend Framework): 
            A JavaScript library used for building dynamic user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). 
            React enables fast rendering of components and real-time interaction with the backend.
      .Node.js (Runtime Environment): A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute server-side code. 
            Node.js is highly efficient and designed to handle asynchronous operations, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications.

# Functioning:
    React handles the user interface and communicates with the backend via APIs.
    Express.js and Node.js manage server-side logic, handle incoming requests, and send data to and from the frontend.
    MongoDB stores and retrieves the application data (e.g., user details, orders, products).
