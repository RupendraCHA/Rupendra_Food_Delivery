# Project Introduction:
  The Rupendra's Food delivery project Created by me includes essential features such as a cart for users to add items, 
  the ability to place orders, providing address details for delivery, and making fake payments for testing purposes. 
  These features simulate a real-world food ordering process, allowing users to seamlessly select their meals, 
  provide delivery information, and complete transactions in a simulated environment, making the app functional and ready for further development.
